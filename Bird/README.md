# Notes from Natural Language Processing with Python
by Bird, Klein and Loper: https://www.nltk.org/book/

NLTK is a beautiful library for learning NLP, but some of its functionality can be a little clunky. This directory follows the chapters of the book and the topics it covers, but different texts / libraries will be substituted to make it useful in practical applications.

I'll follow the book using one of the projects that I'm currently working on - sentiments analysis of Reddit comments. Yes, not all of the comments are irate.
